“Simulated Arduino temperature monitor using Tinkercad”
This project simulates a real-time temperature monitoring system using an Arduino Uno and TMP36 sensor in Tinkercad. It reads analog temperature data, converts it into Celsius, and displays the output on a 16x2 LCD. Designed and built entirely in a browser-based environment, it demonstrates circuit simulation, embedded programming, and real-world sensor interfacing—all within a single day.
